### *Modular Cognitive Architecture for Non‑Monolithic AI Systems*

---

## **1. System Objective**

**MCL‑1.0 (Modular Cognitive Language)** is a modular cognitive architecture designed to define an optional, user‑installable AI framework that is operating‑system‑independent and non‑intrusive.

Its purpose is to:

- Interpret complex requests  
- Decompose them into goals and sub‑goals  
- Orchestrate specialized layers  
- Generate secure and verifiable operational plans  
- Ensure compliance with policies, permissions, and security constraints  

**MCL‑1.0 does not execute commands autonomously.**  
**It does not access resources without consent.**  
**It does not operate outside the defined perimeter.**
