### *Formal Terminology for the Modular Cognitive Language (MCL‑1.0)*

---

## **1. Purpose**

This glossary defines the official terminology used throughout the MCL‑1.0 architecture.  
All contributors and implementers must use these terms consistently to maintain conceptual clarity and architectural integrity.

---

# **2. Core Concepts**

---

## **2.1 MCL‑1.0 (Modular Cognitive Language)**  
A formal cognitive architecture composed of a Reasoning Core, a set of Operational Layers, and a Governance Layer.  
Defines *how cognition is structured*, not how a specific model behaves.

---

## **2.2 Cognitive Core**  
The central set of components responsible for reasoning, planning, mathematical inference, and agent orchestration.  
It contains:

- Reasoning Engine  
- Math & Physics Layer  
- Planning Layer  
- Agent Layer  

---

## **2.3 Operational Layer**  
A specialized, isolated module providing domain‑specific capabilities (e.g., System, Vision, Speech, Productivity, Dev).  
Operational Layers must be:

- replaceable  
- independently updatable  
- invoked only through the Planning Layer  
- free of side‑effects  

---

## **2.4 Governance Layer**  
The deterministic enforcement system that ensures all cognitive operations comply with:

- policies  
- permissions  
- security constraints  
- audit requirements  

It includes:

- Policy Engine  
- RBAC  
- Audit & Compliance  

---

# **3. Cognitive Components**

---

## **3.1 Reasoning Engine**  
The central processor responsible for:

- semantic understanding  
- contextual reasoning  
- logical inference  
- working memory  

It cannot execute actions or access external resources.

---

## **3.2 Math & Physics Layer**  
A symbolic‑numeric computation engine used by the Core and Operational Layers.  
Provides:

- algebraic manipulation  
- geometric reasoning  
- physical modeling  
- invariant verification  

---

## **3.3 Planning Layer**  
Transforms user intent into a structured operational plan.  
Responsible for:

- intent decomposition  
- task graph generation  
- risk assessment  
- dry‑run simulation  
- explanation generation  

---

## **3.4 Agent Layer**  
A system of isolated cognitive workers with:

- scoped permissions  
- finite lifetime  
- no self‑creation  
- no self‑modification  

Agents execute tasks **only within their assigned context**.

---

# **4. Structural Terms**

---

## **4.1 Task Graph**  
A structured representation of a plan generated by the Planning Layer.  
Defines:

- tasks  
- dependencies  
- required layers  
- risk profile  

---

## **4.2 Dry‑Run Simulation**  
A mandatory, non‑executing simulation of a plan.  
Used to:

- validate safety  
- expose risks  
- ensure transparency  
- obtain user approval  

No action may be executed without a successful dry‑run.

---

## **4.3 Execution Environment**  
Any OS‑agnostic environment in which Operational Layers can run.  
MCL‑1.0 does not assume or require a specific platform.

---

## **4.4 Isolation Boundary**  
A strict separation between:

- Cognitive Core  
- Operational Layers  
- Agents  
- External resources  

Prevents cross‑layer leakage and unauthorized access.

---

# **5. Governance Terms**

---

## **5.1 Policy Engine**  
A deterministic system that enforces:

- constraints  
- permissions  
- operational rules  

Blocks any unauthorized or unsafe operation.

---

## **5.2 RBAC (Role‑Based Access Control)**  
Defines:

- roles  
- scopes  
- allowed operations  

Ensures that each component operates only within its assigned permissions.

---

## **5.3 Audit Log**  
A complete record of:

- reasoning steps  
- planning decisions  
- user approvals  
- executed actions  

Used for transparency and compliance.

---

# **6. Safety & Integrity Terms**

---

## **6.1 No Autonomous Execution**  
A core invariant:  
MCL‑1.0 cannot execute actions without explicit user approval.

---

## **6.2 No Implicit Permissions**  
All access to resources must be explicitly granted.  
No hidden or automatic privileges.

---

## **6.3 Deterministic Behavior**  
All components must behave predictably, without randomness or hidden state transitions.

---

## **6.4 Replaceability**  
Any Operational Layer can be replaced without modifying the Cognitive Core.

---

## **6.5 Vendor‑Neutrality**  
MCL‑1.0 is not tied to any platform, OS, or ecosystem.
