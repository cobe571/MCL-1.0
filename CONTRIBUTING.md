### *Guidelines for Contributing to MCL‑1.0*

---

## **1. Introduction**

MCL‑1.0 is currently in its **Conceptual & Architectural Phase**.  
Contributions are welcome, but must strictly follow the principles, structure, and constraints defined in:

- `README.md`  
- `MANIFESTO.md`  
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`  
- `SPECIFICATION.md`  
- `LICENSE`  

This project is **not open‑source**.  
All contributions are subject to review and require explicit approval from the author, **Patrizio Melis**.

---

## **2. Contribution Philosophy**

MCL‑1.0 is a **formal cognitive architecture**, not a software implementation.  
Contributions must:

- preserve conceptual purity  
- maintain modularity  
- respect safety invariants  
- avoid monolithic designs  
- align with the architectural principles of MCL‑1.0  

Any contribution that introduces ambiguity, hidden coupling, or monolithic behavior will be rejected.
